### GitHub Pages Deployment Instructions
1. **Automatic Deployment (Recommended)**:
   - Push changes to the main branch
   - GitHub Actions will automatically build and deploy to the gh-pages branch
   - The game will be available at https://[username].github.io/othello/

2. **Manual Deployment**:
   - Update the repository URL in deploy.sh with your actual GitHub repository
   - Run `./deploy.sh` to build and deploy manually
   - The game will be available at https://[username].github.io/othello/
